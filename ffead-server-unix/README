FEATURES
1. Easy to use View Framework
2. SSL Support available
3. Web Server (Multi process, Multi Threaded – EPOLL based)
4. Inbuilt Authentication handlers and OAUTH support
5. Configuration driven URL mapping
6. Dependency Injection (constructor and setter injection)
7. ORM library (currently implemented for MySQL, Integrated with STL, Table mappings through configuration files –> One – Many, Many – Many ,One – One. The ORM Can be easily extended to other Databases).
8. SOAP Integration (Web Service implementation through configuration file –> Methods in a C++ header file exposed as Web-Services)
9. REST Controller framework (pretty URL's)
10. AJAX Integration (Using property based configuration - On the lines of DWR for Java –> Just define C++ header files and Methods will be exposed as AJAX calls)
11. EJB styled Beans (Remote and Local Interfaces exposed -> C++ files have the services, and the methods to be exposed are defined in a configuration file)
12. Universal Object type for C++ (intelligent pointer - no need of extending any class – identifies the object type)
13. XML based Serialization (Limited -> only for single level /no nesting of objects - header files required)
14. Reflection (Limited –> header files required)
15. Dynamic C++ Pages (Mix HTML and C++ code to produce run time views without web server restart)
16. Template Engine and Dynamic Views generated from C++ objects.
17. Controller Pattern (Implement controllers mapped with URL patterns to define custom behaviors)
18. Request/Response Filters (Implement a chain of custom Filters for Pre/Post processing of request/response)
19. Thread Pool Implementation
20. C++ Interpreter (Limited support)
21. Rule based WEB Behavior(idea can be expanded to other areas application wide)
22. XML Parser (DOM Styled)
23. Database Connection Pooling
24. Internationalization support
25. Utilities such as Timer, Logging, Property Files etc.
26. File Upload
27. FTP Server
28. Security features for Method access (Web Services, AJAX calls, C++ Bean service calls, Server URL’s)
29. Module for Integration of the framework with Apache Web Server
30. Method Invoker Server for cross platform Method Invocation (A daemon per language/platform approach – XML based Serialization/De- Serialization)
